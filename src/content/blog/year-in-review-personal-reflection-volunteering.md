## An introspective look at why showing up matters

I didn’t sign up as a volunteer out of a sense of purpose or a desire to give back. I simply joined a community.

As an introvert, deeply uncomfortable with gatherings of any kind, I often avoided group lunches at work and passed up moments where presence mattered. Over time, I realised I was missing out on opportunities, not because of a lack of capability, but because I wasn’t visible. I was also struggling to gain clarity on my next step forward, which felt especially difficult when I only had my own perspective to rely on.

I thought that surrounding myself with people, hearing different perspectives, and having conversations beyond my immediate role might help. So I joined [Women Devs SG](https://www.linkedin.com/company/women-devs-sg), hoping it would offer clarity and connection.

It did.

Being part of the community gave me exactly what I had set out to find: 

- perspective
- confidence
- a sense of direction

Volunteering, however, was something else entirely. I hadn’t planned for it, and I don’t even fully understand why I signed up. It wasn’t a strategic decision or a deliberate next step.

What drew me in? The people. 

I watched others as they

- contribute in their own ways
- support one another quietly and consistently

Over time, that inspiration nudged me forward. I moved on from being an observer/learner, to someone who shows up and contributes, and gradually become more than I had expected.

The biggest turning point for me was that the same people who influenced me saw value in my journey, and that shifted my perception of responsibility. If my experiences could help someone else move forward, then staying quiet no longer felt right.

I also started noticing something practical. I don’t need to wait for perfection before sharing what I know. Writing, speaking, and contributing aren’t signals of having arrived somewhere; they are part of the learning process itself.  

Being in the community makes it easier to try. Not because of pressure, but because participation feels normal. [Women Devs SG](https://www.linkedin.com/company/women-devs-sg) is a safe space to experiment and explore new versions of myself.

/>

That mindset carries over into how I approach my work and my career. Decisions no longer feel like something I have to figure out alone; on the other hand, they feel more consequential. I’m more aware that how I move forward can influence others, and the steps I take are more mindful. 

None of this feels forced. The changes happened naturally, gradually, and almost effortlessly.   

All I had to do was show up.
