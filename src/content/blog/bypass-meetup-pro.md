  How to bypass the Meetup Pro popup when registering for our events
---

WomenDevsSG is a community dedicated to empowering women in tech across any experience level and domain. Our events are **free** to attend. You can register for our events on our [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/women-devs-sg/) page.

Recently, it has come to our attention that some members see a **“Join Meetup+”** popup when trying to register for our events and are unsure how to proceed or close the window.

Please note that you do **not** need to subscribe to Meetup+ to attend any WomenDevsSG events.

## How to proceed

If you see the popup, look for the text:

**Continue with free plan**

Clicking this text will close the popup and allow you to continue with your event registration.

## Examples

Meetup presents this popup differently depending on the device and platform you are using. Below are some screenshots for your reference.

/>

## Still stuck?

If you’ve clicked **Continue with free plan** and the window still doesn’t close and ask you to pay for Meetup+, please reach out to us on our [Telegram community](https://t.me/+hh3Fts4oDG41NzQ1) channels or email us at [womendevssg@gmail.com](mailto:womendevssg@gmail.com) and we’ll help you through it. Please continue supporting WomenDevsSG and join our events!
